TJG_PlayerBounties
================

TJG_PlayerBounties lets your users set their own bounties for their enemies using their money.  Whomever kills the target wins the cash!  Targets must be online to set the bounty, but bounties are persistent - they can run but they can't hide forever!

Commands:

/setbounty (reward) (player name) - sets the bounty and deducts reward from your money

/delbounty (name) - cancels the bounty and returns your money


No configurations necessary.  Bounties are stored in the SQLite DB.  I have only tested this on a small server, but it should be safe on a larger server as well.

As usual, if you have any issues please post them here - let me know if you find this useful!
